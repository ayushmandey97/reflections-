When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?	
	When the editing is done on a different system, in that case a remote repository could be used instead of keeping 
	all the work local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because there might be times where our files aren't ready for testing, and so automatic pulls would result in bugs and unfinished code

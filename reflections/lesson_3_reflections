When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?	
	When the editing is done on a different system, in that case a remote repository could be used instead of keeping 
	all the work local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because there might be times where our files aren't ready for testing, and so automatic pulls would result in bugs and unfinished code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are used when copying a repo from a github user to yor github account
	Clones are used for copying a repo from your github profile to your local system
	Branches are used when a different functionality is to be tried other than the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It's beneficial because then we can locally keep track of what changes have been pushed to github.
